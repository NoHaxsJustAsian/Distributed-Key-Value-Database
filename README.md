# Project 6 - 


## Approach

In order to implement this assignment we followed the suggested approach. First we started by reading the raft document through to make sure we understood how the protocol was implemented. Then we implemented each feature in the order that the assignment suggested, following along with the documents description as we went. At times we had to go back and fix earlier parts that we missed or messed up but generally we tried not to go too far off the recommended path. 
 

## Challenges

The Raft protocol is very complicated. On top of how difficult it is to implement, we weren't exactly sure what parts of the raft protocol would be necessary for this assignment. So, figuring out what the given tests and assignment expected from us was one of our biggest challenges.

## Testing

We tested the project using many print statements that allowed us to monitor how the replicas were behaving and make sure the protocol was being carried out as we expected. We also analyzed the simulator's test results to determine what was expected for our program.
